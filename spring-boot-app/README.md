# Spring Boot based Java web application
 
This is a simple Sprint Boot based Java application that can be built using Maven. Sprint Boot dependencies are handled using the pom.xml 
at the root directory of the repository.

This is a MVC architecture based application where controller returns a page with title and message attributes to the view.

## Execute the application locally and access it using your browser

Checkout the repo and move to the directory

```
git clone https://github.com/iam-veeramalla/Jenkins-Zero-To-Hero/java-maven-sonar-argocd-helm-k8s/sprint-boot-app
cd java-maven-sonar-argocd-helm-k8s/sprint-boot-app
```

Execute the Maven targets to generate the artifacts

```
mvn clean package
```

The above maven target stroes the artifacts to the `target` directory. You can either execute the artifact on your local machine
(or) run it as a Docker container.

** Note: To avoid issues with local setup, Java versions and other dependencies, I would recommend the docker way. **


### Execute locally (Java 11 needed) and access the application on http://localhost:8080

```
java -jar target/spring-boot-web.jar
```

### The Docker way

Build the Docker Image

```
docker build -t ultimate-cicd-pipeline:v1 .
```

```
docker run -d -p 8010:8080 -t ultimate-cicd-pipeline:v1
```

Hurray !! Access the application on `http://<ip-address>:8010`


## Next Steps

### Configure a Sonar Server locally

```
apt install unzip
adduser sonarqube
wget https://binaries.sonarsource.com/Distribution/sonarqube/sonarqube-9.4.0.54424.zip
unzip *
chmod -R 755 /home/sonarqube/sonarqube-9.4.0.54424
chown -R sonarqube:sonarqube /home/sonarqube/sonarqube-9.4.0.54424
cd sonarqube-9.4.0.54424/bin/linux-x86-64/
./sonar.sh start
```

Hurray !! Now you can access the `SonarQube Server` on `http://<ip-address>:9000` 

# Jenkins Pipeline for Java based application using Maven, SonarQube, Argo CD, Helm and Kubernetes


Here are the step-by-step details to set up an end-to-end Jenkins pipeline for a Java application using SonarQube, Argo CD, Helm, and Kubernetes:

Prerequisites:

   -  Java application code hosted on a Git repository
   -   Jenkins server
   -  Kubernetes cluster
   -  Helm package manager
   -  Argo CD

Steps:

    1. Install the necessary Jenkins plugins:
       1.1 Git plugin
       1.2 Maven Integration plugin
       1.3 Pipeline plugin
       1.4 Kubernetes Continuous Deploy plugin

    2. Create a new Jenkins pipeline:
       2.1 In Jenkins, create a new pipeline job and configure it with the Git repository URL for the Java application.
       2.2 Add a Jenkinsfile to the Git repository to define the pipeline stages.

    3. Define the pipeline stages:
        Stage 1: Checkout the source code from Git.
        Stage 2: Build the Java application using Maven.
        Stage 3: Run unit tests using JUnit and Mockito.
        Stage 4: Run SonarQube analysis to check the code quality.
        Stage 5: Package the application into a JAR file.
        Stage 6: Deploy the application to a test environment using Helm.
        Stage 7: Run user acceptance tests on the deployed application.
        Stage 8: Promote the application to a production environment using Argo CD.

    4. Configure Jenkins pipeline stages:
        Stage 1: Use the Git plugin to check out the source code from the Git repository.
        Stage 2: Use the Maven Integration plugin to build the Java application.
        Stage 3: Use the JUnit and Mockito plugins to run unit tests.
        Stage 4: Use the SonarQube plugin to analyze the code quality of the Java application.
        Stage 5: Use the Maven Integration plugin to package the application into a JAR file.
        Stage 6: Use the Kubernetes Continuous Deploy plugin to deploy the application to a test environment using Helm.
        Stage 7: Use a testing framework like Selenium to run user acceptance tests on the deployed application.
        Stage 8: Use Argo CD to promote the application to a production environment.

    5. Set up Argo CD:
        Install Argo CD on the Kubernetes cluster.
        Set up a Git repository for Argo CD to track the changes in the Helm charts and Kubernetes manifests.
        Create a Helm chart for the Java application that includes the Kubernetes manifests and Helm values.
        Add the Helm chart to the Git repository that Argo CD is tracking.

    6. Configure Jenkins pipeline to integrate with Argo CD:
       6.1 Add the Argo CD API token to Jenkins credentials.
       6.2 Update the Jenkins pipeline to include the Argo CD deployment stage.

    7. Run the Jenkins pipeline:
       7.1 Trigger the Jenkins pipeline to start the CI/CD process for the Java application.
       7.2 Monitor the pipeline stages and fix any issues that arise.

This end-to-end Jenkins pipeline will automate the entire CI/CD process for a Java application, from code checkout to production deployment, using popular tools like SonarQube, Argo CD, Helm, and Kubernetes.

# Jenkins-Zero-To-Hero

Are you looking forward to learn Jenkins right from Zero(installation) to Hero(Build end to end pipelines)? then you are at the right place. 

## Installation on EC2 Instance

Install Jenkins, configure Docker as agent, set up cicd, deploy applications to k8s and much more.

## AWS EC2 Instance

- Go to AWS Console
- Instances(running)
- Launch instances

### Install Jenkins.

Pre-Requisites:
 - Java (JDK)

### Run the below commands to install Java and Jenkins

Install Java

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install openjdk-17-jre
```

Verify Java is Installed

```
java -version
```

Now, you can proceed with installing Jenkins

```
curl -fsSL https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian/jenkins.io-2023.key | sudo tee \
  /usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc > /dev/null
echo deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc] \
  https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian binary/ | sudo tee \
  /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list > /dev/null
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install jenkins
```

**Note: ** By default, Jenkins will not be accessible to the external world due to the inbound traffic restriction by AWS. Open port 8080 in the inbound traffic rules as show below.

- EC2 > Instances > Click on <Instance-ID>
- In the bottom tabs -> Click on Security
- Security groups
- Add inbound traffic rules as shown in the image (you can just allow TCP 8080 as well, in my case, I allowed `All traffic`).

<img width="1187" alt="Screenshot 2023-02-01 at 12 42 01 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43399466/215975712-2fc569cb-9d76-49b4-9345-d8b62187aa22.png">


### Login to Jenkins using the below URL:

http://<ec2-instance-public-ip-address>:8080    [You can get the ec2-instance-public-ip-address from your AWS EC2 console page]

Note: If you are not interested in allowing `All Traffic` to your EC2 instance
      1. Delete the inbound traffic rule for your instance
      2. Edit the inbound traffic rule to only allow custom TCP port `8080`
  
After you login to Jenkins, 
      - Run the command to copy the Jenkins Admin Password - `sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword`
      - Enter the Administrator password
 
### Click on Install suggested plugins


Wait for the Jenkins to Install suggested plugins

Create First Admin User or Skip the step [If you want to use this Jenkins instance for future use-cases as well, better to create admin user]

Jenkins Installation is Successful. You can now starting using the Jenkins 

## Install the Docker Pipeline plugin in Jenkins:

   - Log in to Jenkins.
   - Go to Manage Jenkins > Manage Plugins.
   - In the Available tab, search for "Docker Pipeline".
   - Select the plugin and click the Install button.
   - Restart Jenkins after the plugin is installed.
 
Wait for the Jenkins to be restarted.


## Docker Slave Configuration

Run the below command to Install Docker

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install docker.io
```
 
### Grant Jenkins user and Ubuntu user permission to docker deamon.

```
sudo su - 
usermod -aG docker jenkins
usermod -aG docker ubuntu
systemctl restart docker
```

Once you are done with the above steps, it is better to restart Jenkins.

```
http://<ec2-instance-public-ip>:8080/restart
```

The docker agent configuration is now successful.
